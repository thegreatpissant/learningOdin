Directories:
* .aicontext : prompts for ai to use if I was to use it for code review.
* assets : images and other items to use 
* Bomber : kaboom clone using SDL3
* docs / : more ai prompts for code review
* learnOdin/[1,4,5,6,7,8,raylib] : https://learnodin.org/
* runningTests : https://odin-lang.org/docs/testing/
* sdl : https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL3/index.php
* scratch : Random items
* sdlAppWithCallbacks : Example using SDL3 callbacks
* TicTacToe : TicTacToe clone using SDL3

Notes:
* run each by abs path from root of repo. For example `odin run ./sdl/ex17/ex17.odin -file`
* The clones are cattle
* Should I need a UI maybe use microui https://gist.github.com/gingerBill/5bbcca224bf8d9dcd09dde38b2567d10
* The ai stuff is ideas I had for using llm's for code review.  Havent used it yet, otherwise hand crafted farm to table code.  :-)
